# Yūgen's Terrain Authoring Toolkit
The public version of the Marching Squares Terrain plugin for godot.

This project is an effort to create a simple to use and powerfull terrain authoring tool inside godot aimed at 3d pixel art games. However, the plugin featured in this project can be used for a wide variety of games and experimentation is encouraged! As of right now the plugin has the following features:

* Elevate and lower terrain based on cells in a chunk grid
* Level terrain to a user-set height
* Smooth terrain depending on the average height of neighbouring cells
* Create a bridge between two points by drawing a line between them
* Paint up to 15(+1) custom textures onto the terrain
* Paint a mask map that determines whether selected cells should draw `MultiMeshInstance3d` grass instances
* Get debug information for selected cells
* Change the internal marching squares algorithm vertex merge threshold value resulting in smoother or blockier terrain
* Change global terrain settings like wall texture, wall color, grass animation fps and more...

###
A big thanks to the above people for giving helpful insights, discussing certain features and thinking together about math related problems. Without them I couldn't have finished the plugin as fast as I have.
